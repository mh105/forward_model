abstract = {In the field of computational biomechanics, investigators have primarily used commercial software that is neither geared toward biological applications nor sufficiently flexible to follow the latest developments in the field. This lack of a tailored software environment has hampered research progress, as well as dissemination of models and results. To address these issues, we developed the FEBio software suite (http://mrl.sci.utah.edu/software/febio), a nonlinear implicit finite element (FE) framework, designed specifically for analysis in computational solid biomechanics. This paper provides an overview of the theoretical basis of FEBio and its main features. FEBio offers modeling scenarios, constitutive models, and boundary conditions, which are relevant to numerous applications in biomechanics. The open-source FEBio software is written in C++, with particular attention to scalar and parallel performance on modern computer architectures. Software verification is a large part of the development and maintenance of FEBio, and to demonstrate the general approach, the description and results of several problems from the FEBio Verification Suite are presented and compared to analytical solutions or results from other established and verified FE codes. An additional simulation is described that illustrates the application of FEBio to a research problem in biomechanics. Together with the pre- and postprocessing software PREVIEW and POSTVIEW, FEBio provides a tailored solution for research and development in computational biomechanics.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd. Although the socket is critical in a prosthetic system for a person with limb amputation, the methods of its design are largely artisanal. A roadblock for a repeatable and quantitative socket design process is the lack of predictive and patient specific biomechanical models of the residuum. This study presents the evaluation of such a model using a combined experimental-numerical approach. The model geometry and tissue boundaries are derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The soft tissue non-linear elastic and viscoelastic mechanical behavior was evaluated using inverse finite element analysis (FEA) of in-vivo indentation experiments. A custom designed robotic in-vivo indentation system was used to provide a rich experimental data set of force versus time at 18 sites across a limb. During FEA, the tissues were represented by two layers, namely the skin-adipose layer and an underlying muscle-soft tissue complex. The non-linear elastic behavior was modeled using 2nd order Ogden hyperelastic formulations, and viscoelasticity was modeled using the quasi-linear theory of viscoelasticity. To determine the material parameters for each tissue, an inverse FEA based optimization routine was used that minimizes the combined mean of the squared force differences between the numerical and experimental force-time curves for indentations at 4 distinct anatomical regions on the residuum. The optimization provided the following material parameters for the skin-adipose layer: [. c=5.22kPa m=4.79 $\gamma$=3.57MPa $\tau$=0.32s] and for the muscle-soft tissue complex [. c=5.20kPam=4.78$\gamma$=3.47MPa$\tau$=0.34s]. These parameters were evaluated to predict the force-time curves for the remaining 14 anatomical locations. The mean percentage error (mean absolute error/ maximum experimental force) for these predictions was 7Â±3{\%}. The mean percentage error at the 4 sites used for the optimization was 4{\%}.},

abstract = {AbstractPressure ulcers are a type of local soft tissue injury due to sustained mechanical loading and remain a common issue in patient care. People with spinal cord injury (SCI) are especially at risk of pressure ulcers due to impaired mobility and sensory perception. The development of load improving support structures relies on realistic tissue load evaluation e.g. using finite element analysis (FEA). FEA requires realistic subject-specific mechanical properties and geometries. This study focuses on the effect of geometry. MRI is used for the creation of geometrically accurate models of the human buttock for three able-bodied volunteers and three volunteers with SCI. The effect of geometry on observed internal tissue deformations for each subject is studied by comparing FEA findings for equivalent loading conditions. The large variations found between subjects confirms the importance of subject-specific FEA.},

abstract = {Biomechanical interfaces are mechanical structures that form the connection between a device and a tissue region, and, through appropriate load transfer, aim to minimize tissue discomfort and injury. A patient-specific and data-driven computational framework for the automated design of biomechanical interfaces is presented here. Optimization of the design of biomechanical interfaces is complex since it is affected by the interplay of the geometry and mechanical properties of both the tissue and the interface. The proposed framework is presented for the application of transtibial amputee prostheses where the interface is formed by a prosthetic liner and socket. Conventional socket design and manufacturing is largely artisan, non-standard, and insufficiently data-driven, leading to discrepancies between the quality of sockets produced by different prosthetists. Furthermore, current prosthetic liners are often not patient-specific. The proposed framework involves: A) non-invasive imaging to record patient geometry, B) indentation to assess tissue mechanical properties, C) data-driven and automated creation of patient-specific designs, D) patient-specific finite element analysis (FEA) and design evaluation, and finally E) computer aided manufacturing. Uniquely, the FEA procedure controls both the design and mechanical properties of the devices, and simulates, not only the loading during use, but also the pre-load induced by the donning of both the liner and the socket independently. Through FEA evaluation, detailed information on internal and external tissue loading, which are directly responsible for discomfort and injury, are available. Further, these provide quantitative evidence on the implications of design choices, e.g. : 1) alterations in the design can be used to locally enhance or reduce tissue loading, 2) compliant features can aid in relieving local surface pressure. The proposed methods form a patient-specific, data-driven and repeatable design framework for biomechanical interfaces, and by enabling FEA-based optimization reduces the requirement for repeated patient involvement in the currently manual and iterative design process.},

@article{Cooney2015,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd. Incisional hernia is a severe complication post-laparoscopic/laparotomy surgery that is commonly associated with the linea alba. However, the few studies on the mechanical properties of the linea alba in the literature appear contradictory, possible due to challenges with the physical dimensions of samples and variations in protocol. This study focuses on the tensile mechanical characterisation of the porcine linea alba, as determined by uniaxial and equi-load biaxial testing using image-based strain measurement methods. Results show that the linea alba demonstrated a non-linear elastic, anisotropic behaviour which is often observed in biological soft tissues. The transverse direction (parallel to fibres) was found to be approximately eight times stiffer than the longitudinal (cross-fibre) direction under both uniaxial and equi-load biaxial loading. The equi-load biaxial tensile tests revealed that contraction could occur in the transverse direction despite increasing load, probably due to the anisotropy of the tissue. Optical surface marker tracking and digital image correlation methods were found to greatly improve the accuracy of stretch measurement, resulting in a 75{\%} change in the apparent stiffness compared to using strain derived from machine cross-head displacement. Additionally, a finite element model of the experiments using a combination of an Ogden and fibre exponential power law model for the linea alba was implemented to quantify the effect of clamping and tissue dimensions (which are suboptimal for tensile testing) on the results. The preliminary model results were used to apply a correction factor to the uniaxial experimental data prior to inverse optimisation to derive best fit material parameters for the fibre reinforced Ogden model. Application of the model to the equi-load biaxial case showed some differences compared to the experimental data, suggesting a more complex anisotropic model may be necessary to capture biaxial behaviour. These results provide an improved assessment of the mechanical properties of the porcine linea alba for wound closure and other studies.},

abstract = {This paper discusses tension-compression asymmetry properties of Ogden hyperelastic formulations. It is shown that if all negative or all positive Ogden coefficients are used, tension-compression asymmetry occurs the degree of which cannot be separately controlled from the degree of non-linearity. A simple hybrid form is therefore proposed providing separate control over the tension-compression asymmetry. It is demonstrated how this form relates to a newly introduced generalised strain tensor class which encompasses both the tension-compression asymmetric Seth-Hill strain class and the tension-compression symmetric Ba{\v{z}}ant strain class. If the control parameter is set to q= 0.5 a tension-compression symmetric form involving Ba{\v{z}}ant strains is obtained with the property $\Psi$($\lambda$1,$\lambda$2,$\lambda$3)=$\Psi$(1/$\lambda$1,1/$\lambda$2,1/$\lambda$3). The symmetric form may be desirable for the definition of ground matrix contributions in soft tissue modelling allowing all deviation from the symmetry to stem solely from fibrous reinforcement. Such an application is also presented demonstrating the use of the proposed formulation in the modelling of the non-linear elastic and transversely isotropic behaviour of skeletal muscle tissue in compression (the model implementation and fitting procedure have been made freely available). The presented hyperelastic formulations may aid researchers in independently controlling the degree of tension-compression asymmetry from the degree of non-linearity, and in the case of anisotropic materials may assist in determining the role played by, either the ground matrix, or the fibrous reinforcing structures, in generating asymmetry.},

@article{Takaza2013,
abstract = {Appropriate mechanical representation of passive muscle tissue is crucial for human body impact modelling. In this paper the experimental and modelling results of compressive loading of freshly slaughtered porcine muscle samples using a drop-tower testing rig are reported. Fibre and cross-fibre compression tests at strain rates varying from 11,600{\%}/s to 37,800{\%}/s were performed. Experimental results show a nonlinear stress-stretch relationship as well as a clear rate dependency of the stress. The mean (standard deviation) engineering stress in the fibre direction at a stretch of 0.7 was 22.47 kPa (5.34 kPa) at a strain rate of 22,000{\%}/s and 38.11k Pa (5.41 kPa) at a strain rate of 37,800{\%}/s. For the cross-fibre direction, the engineering stresses were 5.95 kPa (1.12 kPa) at a strain rate of 11,600{\%}/s, 25.52 kPa (5.12 kPa) at a strain rate of 22,000{\%}/s and 43.66 kPa (6.62 kPa) at a strain rate of 37,800{\%}/s. Significant local strain variations were observed, as well as an average mass loss of 8{\%} due to fluid exudation, highlighting the difficulties in these kinds of tests. The inverse analysis shows for the first time that the mechanical response in terms of both applied load and tissue deformation for each of the strain rates can be captured using a 1st order Ogden hyperelastic material law extended with a three-term quasilinear viscoelastic (QVL) expansion to model viscoelastic effects. An optimisation procedure was used to derive optimal material parameters for which the error in the predicted boundary condition force at maximum compression was less than 3{\%} for all three rates of testing (11,600{\%}/s, 22,000{\%}/s and 37,800{\%}/s). This model may be appropriate for whole body impact modelling at these rates. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Moerman2012a,
abstract = {Purpose: Typically spatial modulation of the magnetization (SPAMM) tagged magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) requires many repeated motion cycles limiting the applicability to highly repeatable tissue motions only. This paper describes the validation of a novel SPAMM tagged MRI and post-processing framework for the measurement of complex and dynamic 3D soft tissue deformation following just three motion cycles. Techniques are applied to indentation induced deformation measurement of the upper arm and a silicone gel phantom. Methods: A SPAMM tagged MRI methodology is presented allowing continuous (3.3-3.6 Hz) sampling of 3D dynamic soft tissue deformation using non segmented 3D acquisitions. The 3D deformation is reconstructed by the combination of three mutually orthogonal tagging directions, thus requiring only three repeated motion cycles. In addition a fully automatic post-processing framework is presented employing Gabor scale-space and filter-bank analysis for tag extrema segmentation and triangulated surface fitting aided by Gabor filter bank derived surface normals. Deformation is derived following tracking of tag surface triplet triangle intersections. The dynamic deformation measurements were validated using indentation tests (â¼20 mm deep at 12 mm/s) on a silicone gel soft tissue phantom containing contrasting markers which provide a reference measure of deformation. In addition, the techniques were evaluated in vivo for dynamic skeletal muscle tissue deformation measurement during indentation of the biceps region of the upper arm in a volunteer. Results: For the phantom and volunteer tag point location precision were 44 and 92 $\mu$m, respectively resulting in individual displacements precisions of 61 and 91 $\mu$m, respectively. For both the phantom and volunteer data cumulative displacement measurement accuracy could be evaluated and the difference between initial and final locations showed a mean and standard deviation of 0.44 and 0.59 mm for the phantom and 0.40 and 0.73 mm for the human data. Finally accuracy of (cumulative) displacement was evaluated using marker tracking in the silicone gel phantom. Differences between true and predicted marker locations showed a mean of 0.35 mm and a standard deviation of 0.63 mm. Conclusions: A novel SPAMM tagged MRI and fully automatic post-processing framework for the measurement of complex 3D dynamic soft tissue deformation following just three repeated motion cycles was presented. The techniques demonstrate dynamic measurement of complex 3D soft tissue deformation at subvoxel accuracy and precision and were validated for 3.3-3.6 Hz sampling of deformation speeds up to 12 mm/s. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

abstract = {Low back pain is a major cause of disability and requires the development of new devices to treat pathologies and improve prognosis following surgery. Understanding the effects of new devices on the biomechanics of the spine is crucial in the development of new effective and functional devices. The aim of this study was to develop a preliminary parametric, scalable and anatomically accurate finite-element model of the lumbar spine allowing for the evaluation of the performance of spinal devices. The principal anatomical surfaces of the lumbar spine were first identified, and then accurately fitted from a previous model supplied by S14 Implants (Bordeaux, France). Finally, the reconstructed model was defined according to 17 parameters which are used to scale the model according to patient dimensions. The developed model, available as a toolbox named the lumbar model generator, enables generating a population of models using subject-specific dimensions obtained from data scans or averaged dimensions evaluated from the correlation analysis. This toolbox allows patient-specific assessment, taking into account individual morphological variation. The models have applications in the design process of new devices, evaluating the biomechanics of the spine and helping clinicians when deciding on treatment strategies.},
